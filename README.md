## Hi 👋

- 🧠 I mostly work on operating systems and graphics/raytracing, but sometimes I mix in some games/gui.
- 📖 I've written tons of Rust and Python, but I also use Julia, Bash, Java and C.
- ✏️ I tend to switch between projects a lot, you can see what I'm working on in [my repos](https://github.com/Dworv?tab=repositories).
- 💬 You can reach at `Dworv#0001` on Discord.
